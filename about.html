    <p>Is there something you want to do that freaks you out? Go for it! Sometimes, the scariest ideas turn into the best travel memories.
        We at "THE ROAD UNKNOWN" try to share those with the world so that someone out there can create their own memories from your expirience.
        If you think that there is a place that everyone  should visit once in a life time tell them through us.
        Let every person out there know the road unknown.
        This is a travel blog website which was created in the year 2017 with an aim to bring the adventurers of the world together and also to ignite the flame of travelling in other peoples' heart </p>
